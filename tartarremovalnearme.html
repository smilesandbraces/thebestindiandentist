      <h2>Why Professional Tartar Removal Matters</h2>
      <p>Tartar is hardened dental plaque that cannot be removed by brushing alone:contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}. Left unchecked, tartar leads to cavities, gum disease, and tooth staining:contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}. Only a dentist or hygienist has the tools to safely scrape away tartar buildup without damaging your teeth:contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}:contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}. Our clinic uses ultrasonic scalers and hand instruments for a gentle, thorough cleaning. After cleaning, your teeth feel smooth and look brighter thanks to a final polish:contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}.</p>
      <p>Keeping up with professional cleanings every 6 months (or as recommended) prevents oral health problems:contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}. We advise patients on daily flossing and brushing with ADA-approved products to minimize plaque. With each visit, we educate you on maintaining a healthy smile. Our comfortable and modern clinic ensures your cleaning is stress-free and effective.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is tartar and why does it need to be removed?</h3>
        <p>Tartar (dental calculus) is hardened plaque that forms on teeth over time:contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}. Unlike soft plaque, tartar cannot be brushed away. Removing it is important because tartar bacteria cause gum inflammation, cavities, and bad breath:contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}. Professional cleaning by a dentist safely eliminates tartar and keeps your teeth healthy.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is tartar removal painful?</h3>
        <p>Most patients feel little or no pain during routine cleaning. The process should not be painful:contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}. If you have sensitive gums or a lot of buildup, we can use topical anesthetic. Our goal is a comfortable, quick visit that leaves you feeling great.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How often should I get a cleaning to remove tartar?</h3>
        <p>For most people, a professional cleaning every six months is recommended:contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}. Some patients with fast buildup may need visits more frequently. We’ll help you determine the right schedule based on your oral health.</p>
